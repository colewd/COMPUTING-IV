Additional Notes: for some of my files the edit distance was over by 2 due to an extra gap that was included at the end of one string but not the other. I'm not sure if this is because I wasn't able to download the .txt files from the zip that was linked on the webpage. I got mine from the princeton site instead and am unsure if those .txt files are different.
