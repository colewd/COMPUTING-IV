Comments: In this assignment I used the Claude Shannon algorithm for a Markov chain to create some nonsense text based on the probabilty of the sequence of letters from a given text in a similar way as predictive text or autofill however much less accurate as its based on a single text file. My executable takes in a text file, k for the k-gram and an output size to make the nonsense text.
