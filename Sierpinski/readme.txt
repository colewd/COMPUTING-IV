In this assignment I created a class sierpinski and overloaded the draw function so I was able to call sierpinski recursively to draw multiple triangles within one another. When constructed the sierpinski class would create a large triangle and then draw, using sprites to the window, smaller level triangles until the depth of recursion has been met. It would create these triangles using the same coordiantes of the previous triangle but of half the length. One on the left, one on the right and the one on top.

**********************************************************************/
I thought this assignment was fairly easy with all the information provided in class. I thought it was fun seeing how the sierpinski triangles design looks cooler the larger the depth of recursion.

To run the executable:
make
./sierpinski (depth of recursion) (window height)
For example:
./sierpinski 3 500
