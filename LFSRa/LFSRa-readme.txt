Explanation:
I stored the seed as a string in my LSFR class and all operations to the seed use the strings class functions like .at(). This uses the char array of the string class and I elected to do this because it is more efficient than parsing into another array which was what I initially tried to do.
For my two additional test functions I did one for a shorter seed (2 bits) and one for a long seed (32 bits). I did the shifts on paper initially to make sure I was using the correct tap position and didn't encounter any real issues with this assignment.

To Run:
When you use the make command it creates 2 executables, an lfsr and a ps2a. The
ps2a is the executable to run the boost tests and the lfsr is an additional main that has some printf style tests for stepping and my generate.

Time to Complete:
Around 5 to 6 hours.
